Right from the kindergarden days, I have had some great tutors. Mentors might be the right word to use considering the influence they had in my upbringing, my traits and for sure my education.

<strong>John Aunty</strong>- My first KG teacher in New Models, Calcutta - her love and affection instilled confidence and faith in the most weepy child of the section feeling terrible amongst all those kids from North and Punjab. She taught me the basics of every vertical division of academics, ate her lunch with me and definitely gave me a feeling of my mother at school.

<strong>Reena Madam</strong>- I had grown up a little, was probably in sixth but had arrived in a new school in a new town. Sreepuram EM school, ISC syllabus and all those blah blah and it was Reena Mam with her amazing charm and persona who helped me and a lot of other new kids settle down, teamed me up with some awesome new friends and made me feel assured.

<strong>Pramode Sir</strong> - For sure, the best teacher I have had. Quite sure this would be the case with a whole lot of confused & muddled up engineering brains. Had Pramode sir not been there ... God knows!

Ok yes, so the title of this article doesn't suit with whatever I have written till now. <i>You could take this for a bit of polish on the surface. For what is going to follow could well give you a feeling that I am one of those disrespectful, ungrateful students to have caught your attention</i>. With whatever you have read, <strong>I wanted it to be crystal clear that I love, respect and will be grateful to my n number of tutors for lighting up the torch for me & quite a few other thousands</strong>.

> Tweet from @neiltyson - 'Some educators, who are quick to say "These students just don't want to learn”, should instead be saying "I suck at my job”.'

<strong>Incident -1</strong>: Happened back in my 3rd year or so. For some horror reason, I had to get into the IT dept. staff room. And Woila, I see 3 - 4 permanent lecturers of mine sitting in the staff room. Thats a rare sight in any case. Theres a discussion going on. Without question, I lend them my ears. The discussion is about paper valuation and the headaches it brought about. Count the number of pages, scribble over it and then put a pass mark - its a damn tedious task you know. Anyways one of my awesome tutors shows up a real happy face with this statement - 'This guy has written like 3 pages for this 15 marks question but I intend to give him only a mere 3.' The next goon in line follows it up with a nice shocker - 'I gave only 15 marks for the whole paper I went through right now. Let him do it once more.'

<strong>Incident -2</strong>: One of my friend walks into the IT dept staff room (Yeah, so you get it now - thats the horror room :) ). Again probably in the 3rd year or so. The 1rst year university results have now been published and the guy in there is scrutinising all those results from the Calicut university website. His eyes gets stuck at the results of a girl (IT branch in some other college in our damn big university ) who seem to have scored high in almost all the subjects. There comes another shocker statement - 'If she is so studious, then how come she got into a self-financing college. Theres something murky. Its Ok, we will get her next year.' For your info, a good number of examination papers were corrected in the aforesaid horror room.

<strong>Incident -3</strong>: Semester 3: C lab examinations & there are no external examiners. My friend completes his test, gets his output and comes out from the lab. Having done very well in our lab exams , we had good times.
3 -4 months, the results are announced. My friend is shocked to see his lab results. Close to 30/100 after getting a decent output and I am sure he would have performed well in his viva too. So then what? Horrors!

One of my classmates finds it difficult to pass her labs even after an unusual exemption of being offered with a chance to change her question. She leaves the lab weeping. A few minutes later, theres a discussion between our lecturers which in short could be summarised as a call being received from the girls mother and asking our 'kind-at-heart' lecturers to do something about it. And yes, as you guessed it right, she just passed her labs.

<strong>Incident -4</strong>: Me & my friends( obviously, there were quite a few ) are in with back papers . As I had mentioned earlier, most of our examination papers are evaluated(supposedly) in our college itself, and thats not a myth. We decided to apply for a revaluation. Such a pacy university as ours is, it took more than a year for our revaluation results to show up. In the mean time, we wrote supplementary exams and got failed repeatedly. But once the revaluation results came up - god were they surprising? All of us passed, and some of them even got double of what they actually got prior to this. Such cases had become quite frequent then and we had serious plans of getting it noticed somewhere. But eventually, the feelings dried up and we just blew off.


I believe that words shouldn't be used to bring about personal grudges. No way is anything above personal. I just wrote it down to reflect the mindsets of a <strong>filthy fraction of an awesome community</strong>. Of course we had great lecturers too. <strong>Vasudevan Sir, Shajeeb Sir, Raneeja mam, Prathibha Mam</strong> and quite a lot of others. But the ones I mentioned in those incidents are some of the most unprofessional and sadistic people I have met on earth. People who covered up 4 modules of a syllabus in 4 lectures and just took of to a malgudy planet after that. No one dared a question.

Might be a bit outrageous, but from what I have heard from my friends and my mother ( who happens to be lecturer herself ) this is a greater problem. <strong>In every profession, the remuneration, rewards & appraisals of an individual is dependent on the result or the outcome of the effort put in. If not, atleast by some standard metric which indicates performance</strong>. So if thats the case, whats the measurable with the dudes referred to here?

* Percentage of students passing out - For sure not, no one gives a damn about that and in any case thats not the most important thing.
* Time spent in mentoring students to attain focus - What? There has to be something.

I am not sure if any one has figured that out. My mother hasn't been able to do as well. My friends, people I know. No one. You don’t expect technical air in such a muddy pool. Sticking to my dept, there weren’t any knowledgeable consultant to guide to nor there was one to point out a reference. Graduates with 0 professional experience mentoring b.tech students in itself appears as a joke. If there are a few tutors worth remembering then they have to be the guest lecturers who despite of lacking professional knowledge had enough grit, intelligence and sincerity in their profession that we did benefit a lot from them. Many of the others as I mentioned were just Engineering horrors!
